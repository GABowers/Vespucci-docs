There are different ways to export different types of data in Vespucci.

One can easily export a spectra by using the spectrum viewer. When a dataset is selected, the spectrum viewer will show each spectra, with its x and y dimensions. Select a desired spectra, then press the "Export Spectrum" button to open a dialog allowing you to save the spectra to any location.

One can export a matrix by selecting the matrix in the dataset navigator, then selecting File>Export Matrix.

Note: The name of the window following "Save" ("Spectra" in this case) is specific to the matrix selected. If the spectral abscissa had been used instead, the window would be titled "Save Spectral Abscissa."
