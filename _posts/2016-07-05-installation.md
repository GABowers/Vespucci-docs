Installing Vespucci requires first going to the website, vespucciproject.org, and downloading the file containing the program.

Selecting the above option allows one to select the desired operating system, after which a file will be downloaded.

If on Windows, a ZIP file will be downloaded. This file must be extracted before use. It can be extracted anywhere.

Once extracted, Vespucci can be run from the executable within the extracted folder.

A Mac OS installation is simple. A DMG file type is first downloaded. Double-click this to mount the "disk image." The mounted image should be opened, and the .app file extracted to the Applications folder. After this, when using the program for the first time, it must be opened by right-clicking and selecting "Open." After running the first time, Vespucci will act like any other installed application.

On Linux, after extracting the archive, ensure that the Vespucci shell script is executable, then execute it:
```
>chmod +x Vespucci
>./Vespucci
```
