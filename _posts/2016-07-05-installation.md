Installing Vespucci requires first going to the website, vespucciproject.org, and downloading the file containing the program.

Selecting the above option allows one to select the desired operating system, after which a file will be downloaded.

### Windows
If on Windows, a ZIP file will be downloaded. This file must be extracted before use. It can be extracted anywhere.

Once extracted, Vespucci can be run from the executable within the extracted folder.

### macOS
A macOS installation is simple. A DMG file is first downloaded. Double-click this to mount the "disk image." The mounted image should be opened, and the .app file copied to the Applications folder. After this, when using the program for the first time, it must be opened by right-clicking and selecting "Open." After running the first time, Vespucci will act like any other installed application.

### Linux
On Linux, after extracting the tarball, ensure that the Vespucci shell script is executable:

```
>chmod +x Vespucci
```
