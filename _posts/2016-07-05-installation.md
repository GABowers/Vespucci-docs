Installing Vespucci requires first going to the website, vespucciproject.org, and downloading the file containing the program.

Selecting the above option allows one to select the desired operating system, after which a file will be downloaded.

If on Windows, a ZIP file will be downloaded. This file must be extracted before use. It can be extracted anywhere.

Once extracted, Vespucci can be run from the executable within the extracted folder.

A Mac OS installation is simple. A DMG file type is first downloaded. Double-click this to mount the "disk image." The mounted image should be opened, and the .app file extracted to the Applications folder. After this, when using the program, it must be opened by right-clicking and selecting "Open."

Linux users are presumed to know what it takes to get the program running. Good luck!
