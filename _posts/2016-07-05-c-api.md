If you wish to use the Vespucci C++ API, you must compile the library yourself. You only need to compile the VespucciLibrary.pro file located in the VespucciLibrary folder of the repository. We provide pre-compiled versions of the dependencies for Vespucci at [github.com/VespucciProject/Vespucci_dependencies](https://github.com/VespucciProject/Vespucci_dependencies). Also peruse install_mac_depts.sh in the repository if you wish to compile on Mac.

Documentation for the C++ API is availible at [vespucciproject.org/Vespucci-docs/doxygen](http://vespucciproject.org/Vespucci-docs/doxygen)
