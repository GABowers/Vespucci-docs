  Abstract                 = {De Jong, S., 1993. SIMPLS: an alternative approach to partial least squares regression. Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 18: 251â€“263. A novel algorithm for partial least squares (PLS) regression, SIMPLS, is proposed which calculates the \{PLS\} factors directly as linear combinations of the original variables. The \{PLS\} factors are determined such as to maximize a covariance criterion, while obeying certain orthogonality and normalization restrictions. This approach follows that of other traditional multivariate methods. The construction of deflated data matrices as in the nonlinear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS)-PLS algorithm is avoided. For univariate y \{SIMPLS\} is equivalent to \{PLS1\} and closely related to existing bidiagonalization algorithms. This follows from an analysis of \{PLS1\} regression in terms of Krylov sequences. For multivariate Y there is a slight difference between the \{SIMPLS\} approach and NIPALS-PLS2. In practice the \{SIMPLS\} algorithm appears to be fast and easy to interpret as it does not involve a breakdown of the data sets. },
